# Image Denoising ‚≠ê

One of the fundamental challenges in the field of image processing and computer vision is image denoising, where the underlying goal is to estimate the original image by suppressing noise from a noise-contaminated version of the image. Image noise may be caused by different intrinsic (i.e., sensor) and extrinsic (i.e.environment) conditions which are often not possible to avoid in practical situations. Therefore, image denoising plays an important role in a wide range of applications such as image restoration, visual tracking, image registration, image segmentation, and image classification, where obtaining the original image content is crucial for strong performance. While many algorithms have been proposed for the purpose of image denoising, the problem of image noise suppression remains an open challenge, especially in situations where the images are acquired under poor conditions where the noise level is very high. We will be exploring non-local means algorithm for image denoising in this repository.


## Non-Local-Means üî•

The NLM is a greedy algorithm. We convert the image into a matrix with their color
values (in this case gray-scale values). The basic idea to denoise an image is to do
some sort of averaging and restoration of the image. Since considering only a single
pixel value is error prone, we zoom out a bit to consider a small square around the pixel
of interest. This small square is called a patch.
A patch is transformed into a feature vector simply by reshaping it as a vector. It can
also be interpreted as the coordinates of the central pixel in a high dimensional space
that describes all the possible image patches.
Then the distance between similar patches is computed. The denoised value of a given
pixel is obtained as the weighted average of the other pixels of the image, where the
weight (or contribution) of each pixel is inversely proportional to the distance between its
patch and the reference patch of the pixel to denoise.
Since the above process is computationally of very large running time, we limit the
similarity search area to a window around the patch. This, in a way, does limit the
non-locality of the algorithm, but makes it practically possible to use.

### Implementation Details

The following is the stepwise procedure followed for running NLM denoising algorithm
on the image:

- The image is padded using reflect mode( adding extra boundary around image
using the color values already present in the image) to create a wrap around
boundary. This step ensures that we don't go out of bounds while finding window
and neighbours around particles near the image boundary

- After padding the image, the small window surrounding each pixel is
precomputed and stored in a 4D matrix to reduce the running complexity. Later,
the pixels in the small window around any pixel can be found just by indexing the
4D array properly.

- Essentially, the algorithm modifies each pixel value by a weighted average of all
the other pixels, and the weight values are determined by neighborhood similarity
using the formulas given in the research paper. For each pixel and patch, similar
patches are found in the search window, and their weighted averages are taken.
The search window is limited to some value to reduce the running time of the
algorithm as explained above.

### More insight on sigma h, small window and big window parameters

- Small window: It is related to the patch size when comparing similar
neighborhoods. We can't choose a very big patch because all patches will be
different. We cannot choose a small patch either, otherwise all patches will be
similar. Therefore, here we take the small window size to be 7.

- Big window: It is related to the big neighborhood to search for patches as
explained above. The bigger the window the better will be the non-local results,
but it will have larger computational needs. So, considering optimal tradeoff
between CPU and accuracy, here we choose Big Window to be 21

- Sigma h: It is the constant used to control patch difference when we calculate
the weights between patches. It is also closely related to the noise variance
present on image, and it may depend from pixel to pixel. This parameter will vary
from image to image

## Results :bar_chart:

##### Metrics (MSE and PSNR) obtained for both gaussian filtering, NLM filtering, SkImage NLM filtering and the noisy image for all the 10 images, using some fixed h value (in this case 30)

Note: Better NLM values can be obtained using different salt_and_pepper_h value and gaussian_h_value. These tabulations only consider both h to be equal to 30.

## Observations :notebook:

The Gaussian filter blurs the noisy image, thus reducing the visual quality of the image whereas the NLM filter preserves the edges by finding similar patches in a non-local area and trying to eliminate the noise with better averaging. In some cases we can observe from the data and the result images, that gaussian filtering is better or comparable with the NLM filtering, both in metrics and visually. It is because the image is of better resolution (such as image 8) and thus the gaussian filtering blurring effect is not visible on the edges of the image.

### Salt And Pepper Noise

It can be seen from the above data, that in most of the cases in salt and pepper noise,
NLM filtering provides slightly better (almost comparable) results to gaussian filtering.
In salt and pepper noise, the pixel values are deviating from the original value at specific
random points. Therefore, the gaussian filter blurring effect averages out the pixel
values from its immediate neighbours. Therefore the gaussian filtering method works
comparable to NML for salt and pepper noises on metrics. However, if the image
resolution is not good then visually NML image is much better than gaussian filtering.

### Gaussian Noise

In gaussian noise, we can see from the data that the NLM outperforms gaussian filtering
in almost all the images both visually and on metrics. This is because the noise is
distributed normally at random and thus the NLM patch similarity functionality restores
the image much better than the blurring gaussian filter.


In general, the NLM filter works well in cases where there are large patches of the
image with a similar color value, whereas the gaussian filtering does not usually
preserve edges.

## Note: Results for filters and noise can be found under the results directory in the repo. Nevertheless, the same can be again generated by running the code. Other images can be used as well
